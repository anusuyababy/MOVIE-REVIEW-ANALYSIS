0,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
1,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
2,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary."
3,"Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.
I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
4,"Legal historians and courtroom drama fans will have a field day with this Aaron Sorkin film which depicts the trial of eight radical protesters who made a name for themselves in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A disparate array of left-wing activists who took it upon themselves to demand an end to the Vietnam War instead became involved in the ghastly legal aftermath of the riots and thus faced criminal charges for allegedly instigating the violence. This film portrays the sham trial that took place.Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, who has not been in anything good for a long time, is solid as the lead federal prosecutor who reluctantly takes on the assignment of trying to put the radical protesters behind bars. Mark Rylance's modest, down-to-earth demeanor makes him a rather peculiar fit to portray defense attorney William Kuntsler, the famous defense attorney well-known for his outspoken courtroom oratory and publicity hound antics. Frank Langella is flawless as Julius Hoffman, the judge who presided over this trial and whose combustible temper and tenuous mental faculties made him a ready target for ridicule from many, including those involved in the case. Edie Redmayne is excellent as Tom Hayden, the more pragmatic but equally passionate protester and defendant. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are both stellar as defendants Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, respectively. Finally, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is eloquent as Bobby Seale, a Black Panther Party co-founder and the lone African-American defendant in the case.There are discreet details about the trial I was hoping the film would cover. There is no mention of Bobby Seale's many colorful nicknames he assigned to the judge. It mentions the poet Alan Ginsberg only as a fellow protester, when in fact he was also called as one of several celebrity witnesses. So was the musician Judy Collins who began singing an anti-war song during her testimony. These, however, are minor oversights because the fundamental essence of this circus of a trial is effectively captured in the film. Unlike much of Sorkin's earlier work, the dialogue in this film is less grandiose and more straightforward. There are less pyrotechnics and more re-creation here. I mean that as a compliment. It's the perfect portrayal of a trial which turned out to be a low point in the history of American jurisprudence. It also expertly captures the schism within the American left and how the idealists and pragmatists often locked horns even back in the 1960s. Gripping, frightening and instructive in today's world, it is not to be missed. Highly recommended to all."
5,"It feels like this movie is being swept under the rug. I won't say by whom, but I will remove my tin foil hat now. Fantastic fantastic film. This movie really rocked my world. It took me a few days to calm down I was so enraged at the subject matter. Unbelievable crimes against humanity. But because Dupont makes 75 billion dollars a year nobody can touch them. Not even the government. Evvryone should see this. Very thrilling and well made. Mark Rufallo can go fly a kite though. He's the same as he always is"
6,"No idea why some people are rating this so low. To me, it was a fresh, unique take on a brutal topic and it excited me more than any film I've seen recently. I'm not usually a fan of Carey Mulligan but her performance was incredible.
I've never written an IMDB review before but felt compelled to recommend this movie. Go see it."
7,"Hello again folks. I enjoy leaving reviews for these mind twisting movies. Here I will do my best and explain the timelines of the 4 major characters. All characters go through a RED timeline and a BLUE timeline. RED is moving forward and BLUE is moving backwards in the RED timeline. I hope that makes sense. Here we go!1) The Sator Timeline. When he's a young man he finds a box while working in Russia. The box contains gold and the BLUE technology. He's on a mission to find pieces for a doomsday devise that wipes out existence. The last piece he needs is missing. He threatens Kat's life with the Protagonist. He uses the Blue technology to recover the missing piece. He now has all the pieces for the doomsday device. He than goes back to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. The day where Kat sees SOMEONE dive off the boat and says he disappeared.2) TheProtagonist timeline. After the opening opera scene he is tortured, passes a test, and is recruited. He learns of the BLUE technology. He gathers information to lead him down the path and finds the missing piece for Sator. After Kat gets shot he then uses BLUE technology so she can heal. She can heal in the BLUE timeline because she was shot with BLUE technology. Only way to come back to the RED timeline was through another BLUE and RED machine. Only one he has seen was at the airport. So the Protagonist must get them back to the RED timeline using the airport BLUE and RED machine. Protagonist then goes back to the day of the yacht in the RED timeline. Where they remove the doomsday device before the explosion.3) The Neil Timeline. Neil helps the Protagonist in the now RED timeline. Not Neil's RED timeline but the Protagonist's RED. They find what they need to find. After Kat gets shot he goes into the BLUE timeline and along to the airport to get her through the RED and BLUE machine. He then travels to the day of the yacht in the BLUE timeline. As he is in the cave he sees another BLUE and RED machine. Knowing that they caved in the tunnel with explosives he needs to be at multiple places at once. So he then travels again through the BLUE timeline to intercept the Protagonist's failure so the Protagonist does not fail. He gets killed in the process. Keep in mind that when he went through the BLUE twice one of his selfs had to go to the RED timeline. This is where he meets up with them at the end. This is where the Protagonist realized he's dead and it was him who saved him at the opera house in the beginning.4) The Kat timeline. When she meets the Protagonist in the movie it's in the RED timeline. She tells a story about the yacht and she see a woman dive off the boat, the woman diver is herself. Later, Kat gets held hostage by Sator in the RED timeline. Sator is in the same timeline but in BLUE. After the Protagonist saves her they are both captured. Protagonist captured in RED and Kat is captured in BLUE. After she gets shot she heals (Airport scene). She then heads to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. She sees her past self leave the boat with her son and sees Sator leave in his helicopter. Ok this where it gets tricky... Sator comes back but it's not the RED Sator it's the BLUE Sator from the highway scene after he got all the pieces from the doomsday device. The RED Sator left and the BLUE came back in the RED timeline. She kills him. She always killed him. She said earlier at dinner with the Protagonist that she saw a woman dive off the boat and her husband had disappeared. She killed him and slid him off the boat with the lotion she put on his back.Whatever happened was always going to and did happen. Neil says that a few times. But it wasn't until the end where he says it doesn't mean you should sit around and do nothing about it. Kat always kills Sator that day, Neil always dies that day.I hope that clears up some confusions. I did my best without going into the smaller details. Please react if this was helpful or not. Thank you reading those that made it until the end."
8,"This franchise has obviously become a parody. It seems that a very high number of the World's population serve the High Table. They're everywhere, behind every corner, but they cannot kill one single man, even if they stab, shoot, throw him from the hotel roof or hit him with a car at full speed. And the Head of this ""powerful organization"" lives among camels in an African desert ... There are some entertaining moments, however the numerous fighting scenes become dull after a while."
9,"That was INTENSE. Decided to watch this after seeing this film pop up on so many ""2019 Top 10 movies"" lists and I couldn't be happier that I did. Adam Sandler absolutely killed it in this, I kept feeling confused at the choices he made but at the same time felt sorry for him.That ending game though... my palms were sweaty and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if it was going to end badly like most gambling movies do. I was extremely surprised to see him win his bet thinking ""wow this movie actually is going to have a happy ending"" but oh boy was I SHOCKED when Sandler unlocked that door... my jaw was on the ground.Only thing keeping it from a 10 is the ending felt incomplete. What's his family going to think and what's his side piece gonna do once she came back to his dead corpse. Either way this movie was amazing.Edit: wow did not expect so much hate on this film after reading other reviews... not to mention it looks like users here are fishing out positive reviews and marking them all as ""non helpful"". I don't know about those bad reviewers but any movie that has me at a lost for words and a pounding heart rate for that long deserves a spot high up on my list..."
10,"Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year."
11,"I'll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really ""speak"" to me and Alita's eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita's eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone."
12,"Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you."
13,"The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out. Get ready for a slow descent into disturbing madness. This is one for the ages."
14,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this film. They are filled with palpable tension and a general unease at not being able to see the ""monster."" This is another example of how what you cannot see is often scarier than what you can see. The direction is great and perfectly places the viewer in Elizabeth Moss' shoes, which is what generates most of the tension as you the viewer are also unsure where this invisible person is at all times. The spin of domestic violence also lends a new, modern twist on the classic premise.Where the film falters is in its third act with some significant plot holes regarding cameras and visibility of certain actions. There were also several times where the film felt like it was at its conclusion, but kept going. The ending will likely be divisive, however I didn't hate it. The Invisible Man is technically a very well-made thriller, but loses a few marks due to some issues with the plot."
15,"I think this movie was very interesting and full of interesting symbolism. I definitely recommend watching this movie.I have read a lot of different understandings of this movie, but I think that a lot of people maybe misunderstood the role of Miharu. So this is my analysis of the movie:In general, the facility represents society. The levels represent society classes and hierarchies. The protagonist, Goreng, represents a resistance movement who is ready to use threats and violence to secure that there is enough food for everybody. The old man, Trimagasi, represents a supporter of the system. The woman from the administration, Imoguiri, represents a peaceful movement that wants change but is unable to do so. Miharu who rides down the platform actually represents the upper class (se explanation further below).The cellmates believe that the change of levels each month is random. However, the administration does not randomly choose the levels for all prisoners each month. The administration choses if each prisoner should go up or down the levels each month based on whether they have eaten their cellmates or not. If a prisoner is willing to kill his or her cellmate and eat of them then he or she is secured a higher level the next month. This is evidenced a couple of times in the movie: At first Goreng starts on level 48 with Trimagasi and they live peacefully. Then they move down to level 171 the following month where Goreng ends up killing Trimagasi and eats of him to survive. Then Goreng moves up to level 33 the next month where he meets Imoguiri and they live peacefully. Then they move down to level 202 where Goreng is forced to eat of Imoguiri who has killed herself. Then Goreng finally moves up to level 6 where he meets Baharat.The woman Miharu who rides down the platform actually represents the upper class of society because she knows how to exploit the system. Notice that she always rides down the platform and comes from the top floors and she is always bloodied and emotionless. That is because she always makes sure to kill and eat her cellmates every month, and that's why she always ends on the top floors. Miharu rides down the platform to make sure that there is food for the little girl (which we assume is her daughter) on the bottom floor. The girl is always on the bottom floor month after month, because she has never killed and eaten her cellmate. Miharu rides down the platform once a month so she has to make sure that there is enough food for the girl because she cannot get up again until the month is over (the platform only travels back up to level zero, which prisoners presumably are not allowed to enter). That's why she killed so many prisoners on her way down. Miharu must have a good reason to ride down the platform every month and that was to take care of the little girl. Miharu has managed to stay on top and alive for long because she knows the system. However, even she succumbs to the system when she is killed in a fight with the prisoners.Notice that we learn from Imoguiri that she selected Miharu to enter the facility 10 months ago, that she entered alone, and that nobody under 16 years is allowed in the facility. However, we cannot trust Imoguiri's information because she also said that there are 200 levels, which turned out to be false, and the prohibition against under 16 year olds to enter the facility also turned out to be false. So the question of how the little girl ended in the facility remains unanswered. Perhaps the little girl was born in the facility or she was thrown in there with her mother.The movie hints that there is actually enough food for everybody on all floors because the administration puts every prisoner's requested food on the table. This is evidenced when the protagonist is interviewed by the administration official about his favorite food (snails) and that it will be served while he is imprisoned. We also see that the protagonist sees his requested food for the first time when he is on floor no. 6 because none from the upper floors has touched it yet (but he doesn't eat it). He did not get to see his requested food before because those on the upper floors always ate it before it arrived to him. If every prisoner in the facility kept his or her requested food when it arrived at his or her floor, the floor will not turn hot or cold. This is evidenced by one of the last scenes when the protagonist keeps the Panna Cotta when he is at the girl's floor, which must be the favorite food of the girl. All the prisoners had to do was to take their requested food, and not eat the others' food, so the food would be equally distributed all the way to floor no. 333. However, the prisoners from the upper floors greedily ate more than their favorite food leaving less to the ones on the lower levels. So the main message of the movie is that people are very greedy and are ready to take more than they need, and not so much that the system is flawed. We see that the alternative system that the protagonist tries to enforce by distributing little food to everybody also leads to violence and deaths and is not much better.The end of the movie is quite vague, but it does have a meaning. At the end, we don't see what happens to the protagonist, but it is hinted that the protagonist probably dies. Notice that he was heavily injured and barely got on the platform with the girl, when they reached the bottom, then he suddenly he gets off and walks normally when he sees the ghost of Trimagasi. The girl transports upwards to the top floor at the end of the movie. The protagonist is trying to send a message to the administration by transporting the girl to the top. Perhaps the message is to show that despite that most people are greedy, there are also some people who are willing to show benevolence and generosity to save others.I think this movie was very interesting. The movie is open to interpretation, and this is of course my point of view and I hope you found this helpful."
16,Movie that takes place in the 30s it was truly well done and very well thought out. This movie created the mystery of bonnie and clyde and the drama and havoc the created throughout the south. The true story of these 2 retired rangers made this all the more appealing. Kevin costner was a magnificent choice for haymer! Harrelson was perfect as his partner. I really enjoyed the big names in this movie down to Kathy bates. Very happy with the detail this film portrayed.
17,"People rating this movie a 1 or 2 are simply just wrong. Your reasons for a low rating like that is just ridiculous. It's a comedy horror and clearly states that and the trailer clearly shows you that. Sooooo why moan about it having comedic moments in the movie? Just plain dumb.This is a comedy horror done right, it's dark humour breaks up the gore and violence up perfectly. The characters are perfect from the creepy over the top aunt to the leading protagonist Samara weaving. Acting is on point and the movie never slows up(dig to the crazy person saying it's boring)The movie actually has an ending, and what a great ending too. The movie delivers on everything they intended to give you and more.Sooo don't listen to the non constructive low critics and make your own decision and go watch"
18,"Spoilers Ahead, DO NOT CONTINUE!!Look, it's an interesting film that's an ok way to kill 2 hours. But the ending complete ruins the entire premise of the film.The mother we believe to be the good mother is actually the ""evil"" version (who swapped identities in the beginning of the film unbeknownst to the audience).1. The original premise - that the mother does not remember what happened in the mirror house, is perfectly logical. She has amnesia due to fear. However, the amnesia and fear does not hold up if the mother was the evil version all along. There should be no amnesia and the only reason for it is to deliberately trick the audience.2. If the mom was the evil version all along, she shouldn't be scared of a ""shadow"" of herself as she claims. Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the ""Good"" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical."
19,"Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is tasked with extracting the son of a druglord amids an all-out drug war. Battling hostiles and a troubled past along the way.Thank you Jon Wick for upping the game for action films! Extraction excels in its action set pieces. Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating. The film is unapologetically honest in its depiction of violence and its consequences. Riding on fantastic sound design, every impact, bullet wound and car crash pulls you in deeper and deeper in the film."
